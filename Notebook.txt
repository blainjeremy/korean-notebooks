	Hello / Goodbye
	===============

안녕하세요.   Hello.
	안녕   well-being, peace, health
	하세요   you do, do you?, please do

안녕히 계세요.   Goodbye. (you leave, they stay)
안녕히 가세요.   Goodbye. (you stay, they leave)





	Yes / No
	========

네.   Yes.
아니요.   No.

Actually, 네 expresses the agreement to what the other person is saying and 아니요 expresses the disagreement or denial to what the other person is saying.
For example, if someone asks you 커피 안 좋아해요? (You don't like coffee?) and you want to answer "No, I don't like coffee.", then you have to say 네.
So, it is more accurate to put it this way :
	네.   That’s right. / I agree. / Sounds good. / What you said is correct.
	아니요.   That’s not right. / I don’t agree. / What you said is not correct.
More examples :
	커피 좋아해요?   Do you like coffee?
	네. 좋아해요.   Yes, I like coffee.
	
	커피 좋아해요?   Do you like coffee?
	아니요. 안 좋아해요.   No, I don’t like coffee.
	
	커피 안 좋아해요?   You don’t like coffee?
	아니요. 좋아해요.   Yes, I like coffee.
	
	커피 안 좋아해요?   You don’t like coffee?
	네. 안 좋아해요.   No, I don’t like coffee.

네 can be used as a conversation filler too, with the meaning :
	Yes. / That’s right. / I see. / I got it. / I’m here! (when someone calls you) / I understand. / Ah-ha.
Add 맞아요 after 네 in order to express more strongly and clearly that you are saying "You are right" rather than sounding like you are just passively listening while nodding :
	네, 맞아요.   Yes, that’s right.

네 can also have the meaning of "What did you say?" like when you could not hear the person well or you were not paying much attention :
	네?   Pardon me? / I am sorry? / What did you say? / I did not hear you well.

You can also use 네? to show your surprise.





	Thank you
	=========

감사합니다.   Thank you.
	감사   appreciation, thankfulness, gratitude
	합니다   I do, I am doing





	I am sorry / Excuse me
	======================

죄송합니다.   I am sorry. / I apologize.
	죄송   apology, being sorry, feeling ashamed

Only use 죄송합니다 when you want to say "I apologize.", "It was my bad.", "I shouldn't have done that.", ...
It can NEVER mean "I am sorry to hear that.".

When you have to pass through a crowd of people, you can use :
	잠시만요. / 잠깐만요.   Excuse me. / Just a second. (also use these when leaving the room for a second)
	죄송합니다.   Excuse me.

저기요.   Over there. Excuse me. (get someone’s attention (stranger, waiter, ...))
