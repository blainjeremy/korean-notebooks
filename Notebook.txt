	Yes / No
	========

네.   Yes.
아니요.   No.

Actually, 네 expresses the agreement to what the other person said and 아니요 expresses the disagreement or denial to what the other person said.
For example, if someone asks you 커피 안 좋아해요? (You don't like coffee?) and you want to answer "No, I don't like coffee.", then you have to say 네.
So, it is more accurate to put it this way :
	네.   That’s right. / I agree. / Sounds good. / What you said is correct.
	아니요.   That’s not right. / I don’t agree. / What you said is not correct.
More examples :
	커피 좋아해요?   Do you like coffee?
	네. 좋아해요.   Yes, I like coffee.
	
	커피 좋아해요?   Do you like coffee?
	아니요. 안 좋아해요.   No, I don’t like coffee.
	
	커피 안 좋아해요?   You don’t like coffee?
	아니요. 좋아해요.   Yes, I like coffee.
	
	커피 안 좋아해요?   You don’t like coffee?
	네. 안 좋아해요.   No, I don’t like coffee.

네 can also be used as a conversation filler with the meaning :
	Yes. / That’s right. / I see. / I got it. / I’m here! (when someone calls you) / I understand. / Ah-ha.
Add 맞아요 after 네 in order to express more strongly and clearly that you are saying "You are right" rather than sounding like you are just passively listening while nodding :
	네, 맞아요.   Yes, that’s right.

네 can also be have the meaning of "What did you say?" like when you could not hear the person well or you were not paying much attention :
	네?   Pardon me? / I am sorry? / What did you say? / I did not hear you well.

You can also use 네? to show your surprise.
