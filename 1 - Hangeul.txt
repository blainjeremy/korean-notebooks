한글 is an alphabet composed of 24 basic letters called 자모 (자음 = consonant / 모음 = vowel) :
 - 14 basic consonants (기본자음)
 - 10 basic vowels (기본모음/단모음)

More advanced letters based on the basic ones also exist :
 - Twin/double consonants (쌍자음)
 - Diphtongs of vowels (이중모음)



 - Other consonant clusters			()				???



	===============
	Syllable Blocks
	===============

Syllables are composed of at least one (C)onsonant (Initial) and one (V)owel (Medial), then an optional (C)onsonant (Final (받침)) can be added.
The type of syllable block to use depends on the type of vowel and how many letters are in it.
