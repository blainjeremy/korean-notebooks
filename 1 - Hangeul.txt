	Introduction
	============

한글 is an alphabet composed of 24 basic letters called 자모 (자음 = consonant / 모음 = vowel) :
 - 14 basic consonants (기본자음)
 - 10 basic vowels (기본모음/단모음)

More advanced letters based on the basic ones also exist :
 - Twin/double consonants (쌍자음)
 - Diphtongs (이중모음)



 - Other consonant clusters			()				???



Syllables are composed of at least one (C)onsonant (Initial) and one (V)owel (Medial), then an optional (C)onsonant (Final (받침)) can be added.

ㄲ kk (shorter, tense your mouth, make a little pause before, little exhale, acute)			???
ㄸ tt
ㅃ pp
ㅆ ss       ???       (sh when followed by an i-based sound (ㅣ ㅑ ㅛ ㅕ ㅠ ㅖ ㅒ ㅢ))
ㅉ jj (???zz as in pizza)			???



Medial
------

Basic vowels (기본모음/단모음) :

ㅏ a
ㅗ o (closed o)
ㅓ eo (open o)
ㅜ u
ㅡ eu
ㅣ i
ㅑ ya
ㅛ yo
ㅕ yeo
ㅠ yu

Diphtongs (이중모음) :

ㅔ e
ㅐ ae (pronounced like ㅔ) 		but originally was slightly more acute		???
ㅖ ye
ㅒ yae (pronounced like ㅖ) 		but originally was slightly more acute		???

ㄸ, ㅃ and ㅉ are the only consonants not allowed to be used as a Final.

When the next syllable starts with ㅇ, we can orally link them together : for example, 밥을 is pronounced like 바블.

ㅇ ng

Twin/double consonants (쌍자음) :

ㄲ k
ㅆ t
