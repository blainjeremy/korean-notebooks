		============
		Introduction
		============

한글 is an alphabet composed of 24 basic letters (자모 = alphabet/letter => 자음 = consonant / 모음 = vowel) :
 - 14 basic consonants (기본자음)
 - 10 basic vowels (기본모음)

More advanced letters based on the basic ones also exist :
 - Double consonants (쌍자음)
 - Diphtongs (이중모음)
 - Consonant clusters (겹받침)

Syllables are composed of at least one consonant (Initial (초성)) and one vowel (Medial (중성)), then an optional consonant (Final (종성/받침)) can be added.

		Alphabetical Order

Inital : ㄱ ㄲ ㄴ ㄷ ㄸ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅃ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅉ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ
Medial : ㅏ ㅐ ㅑ ㅒ ㅓ ㅔ ㅕ ㅖ ㅗ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ ㅛ ㅜ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅠ ㅡ ㅢ ㅣ
Final  : ㄱ ㄲ ㄳ ㄴ ㄵ ㄶ ㄷ ㄹ ㄺ ㄻ ㄼ ㄽ ㄾ ㄿ ㅀ ㅁ ㅂ ㅄ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ

		Romanization (Pronunciation)
		============================

	Initial
	=======

Basic consonants
----------------

ㄱ g (k/g when first letter of word)
ㄴ n
ㄷ d (t/d when first letter of word)
ㅁ m
ㅂ b (p/b when first letter of word)
ㅅ s (sh when followed by an i-based sound (ㅣ ㅑ ㅛ ㅕ ㅠ ㅖ ㅒ ㅢ))
ㅈ j (ch/j when first letter of word)
ㄹ r (l/r when first letter of word (romanized and pronounced ll when ㄹ + ㄹ))
ㅇ no sound (the syllable starts with the vowel sound)

These aspirated consonants are pronounced with an increased airflow.
ㅋ k
ㅌ t
ㅍ p
ㅊ ch
ㅎ h

To represent the letters v and f in loanwords, ㅂ and ㅍ are respectively used.

Double consonants
-----------------



These consonants are pronounced with less exhale than their basic counterparts.
Pronounced like their basic counterpart but .
(shorter, tense your mouth, make a little pause before, little exhale, acute)			???



ㄲ kk
ㄸ tt
ㅃ pp
ㅆ ss (sh when followed by an i-based sound (ㅣ ㅑ ㅛ ㅕ ㅠ ㅖ ㅒ ㅢ))
ㅉ jj

	Medial
	======

Basic vowels
------------

ㅏ a
ㅗ o  (closed)
ㅓ eo (open)
ㅜ u

ㅑ ya
ㅛ yo  (closed)
ㅕ yeo (open)
ㅠ yu

ㅡ eu
ㅣ i

Diphtongs
---------

ㅔ e
ㅐ ae  (pronounced like ㅔ, but was originally slightly more acute)
ㅖ ye
ㅒ yae (pronounced like ㅖ, but was originally slightly more acute)

ㅘ wa
ㅝ wo (open)

ㅞ we
ㅙ wae (pronounced like ㅞ, but was originally slightly more acute)
ㅚ oe  (pronounced like ㅞ)

ㅟ wi
ㅢ ui (pronounced ㅣ when not following ㅇ (for example, 희 is pronounced 히))

Vowel Harmony
-------------

Bright vowels (양성모음) have ㅏ or ㅗ as base : ㅏ ㅗ ㅑ ㅛ ㅐ ㅒ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ.
Dark   vowels (음성모음) have ㅓ or ㅜ as base : ㅓ ㅜ ㅕ ㅠ ㅔ ㅖ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅡ ㅢ.
ㅣ is Neutral (중성모음).

	Final
	=====

ㄸ, ㅃ and ㅉ are the only consonants not allowed to be used as a Final.

When the next syllable starts with ㅇ, we can orally link them together : for example, 밥을 is pronounced like 바블.
