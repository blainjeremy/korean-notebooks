		Introduction
		============

한글 is an alphabet composed of 24 basic letters called 자모 (자음 = consonant / 모음 = vowel) :
 - 14 basic consonants (기본자음)
 - 10 basic vowels (기본모음)

More advanced letters based on the basic ones also exist :
 - Double consonants (쌍자음)
 - Diphtongs (이중모음)



 - Other consonant clusters			()				???



Syllables are composed of at least one (C)onsonant (Initial) and one (V)owel (Medial), then an optional (C)onsonant (Final (받침)) can be added.

Medial : ㅏ ㅐ ㅑ ㅒ ㅓ ㅔ ㅕ ㅖ ㅗ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ ㅛ ㅜ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅠ ㅡ ㅢ ㅣ
Final : ㄱ ㄲ ㄳ ㄴ ㄵ ㄶ ㄷ ㄹ ㄺ ㄻ ㄼ ㄽ ㄾ ㄿ ㅀ ㅁ ㅂ ㅄ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ

		Romanization (Pronunciation)
		============================

	Initial
	=======

Basic consonants
----------------

ㄱ g (k/g when first letter of word)
ㄴ n
ㄷ d (t/d when first letter of word)
ㅁ m
ㅂ b (p/b when first letter of word)
ㅅ s (sh when followed by an i-based sound (ㅣ ㅑ ㅛ ㅕ ㅠ ㅖ ㅒ ㅢ))
ㅈ j (ch/j when first letter of word)
ㅎ h
ㄹ r (l/r when first letter of word (romanized and pronounced l when ㄹ + ㄹ))
ㅇ no sound (the syllable starts with a vowel sound)



These consonants are pronounced with more exhale than their basic counterparts.
ㅋ k
ㅌ t
ㅍ p
ㅊ ch



Double consonants
-----------------


These consonants are pronounced with less exhale than their basic counterparts.
Pronounced like their basic counterpart but .

ㄲ kk (shorter, tense your mouth, make a little pause before, little exhale, acute)			???
ㄸ tt
ㅃ pp
ㅆ ss       ???       (sh when followed by an i-based sound (ㅣ ㅑ ㅛ ㅕ ㅠ ㅖ ㅒ ㅢ))
ㅉ jj (???zz as in pizza)			???



To represent the letters v and f in loanwords, ㅂ and ㅍ are respectively used.

	Medial
	======

Basic vowels
------------

ㅏ a
ㅗ o (closed)
ㅓ eo (open)
ㅜ u

ㅡ eu
ㅣ i

ㅑ ya
ㅛ yo (closed)
ㅕ yeo (open)
ㅠ yu

Diphtongs
