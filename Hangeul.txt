		============
		Introduction
		============

한글 is an alphabet composed of 24 basic letters (자모 = alphabet/letter => 자음 = consonant / 모음 = vowel) :
 - 14 basic consonants (기본자음)
 - 10 basic vowels (기본모음)

More advanced letters based on the basic ones also exist :
 - Double consonants (쌍자음)
 - Diphtongs (이중모음)
 - Compound consonants (겹받침)

Syllables are composed of at least one consonant (Initial (초성)) and one vowel (Medial (중성)), then an optional consonant (Final (종성/받침)) can be added.

		Alphabetical Order
		==================

Inital : ㄱ ㄲ ㄴ ㄷ ㄸ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅃ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅉ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ
Medial : ㅏ ㅐ ㅑ ㅒ ㅓ ㅔ ㅕ ㅖ ㅗ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ ㅛ ㅜ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅠ ㅡ ㅢ ㅣ
Final  : ㄱ ㄲ ㄳ ㄴ ㄵ ㄶ ㄷ ㄹ ㄺ ㄻ ㄼ ㄽ ㄾ ㄿ ㅀ ㅁ ㅂ ㅄ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ

		Romanization (Pronunciation)
		============================

	Initial
	=======

Basic consonants
----------------

ㄱ g (k/g when first letter of word)
ㄴ n (n/d when first letter of word)
ㄷ d (t/d when first letter of word)
ㄹ r (l/r but romanized and pronounced l when ㄹ + ㄹ)
ㅁ m (m/b when first letter of word)
ㅂ b (p/b when first letter of word)
ㅅ s (sh when followed by an ㅣ-based vowel (ㅣ ㅑ ㅛ ㅕ ㅠ ㅖ ㅒ ㅟ ㅢ))
ㅇ no sound (the syllable starts with the vowel sound)
ㅈ j (ch/j when first letter of word)

Aspirated consonants are pronounced with more airflow :
ㅋ k
ㅌ t
ㅍ p
ㅊ ch
ㅎ h

ㅂ and ㅍ are generally used to represent the letters v and f in loanwords.

Double consonants
-----------------

Double consonants are pronounced with the mouth tensed, less airflow and a higher pitch :
ㄲ kk
ㄸ tt
ㅃ pp
ㅆ ss (sh when followed by an ㅣ-based vowel (ㅣ ㅑ ㅛ ㅕ ㅠ ㅖ ㅒ ㅟ ㅢ))
ㅉ jj

	Medial
	======

Basic vowels
------------

ㅏ a
ㅗ o  (close)
ㅓ eo (open)
ㅜ u

ㅑ ya
ㅛ yo  (close)
ㅕ yeo (open)
ㅠ yu

ㅡ eu
ㅣ i

Diphtongs
---------

ㅔ e
ㅐ ae  (pronounced like ㅔ)
ㅖ ye
ㅒ yae (pronounced like ㅖ)

ㅘ wa
ㅝ wo (open)

ㅞ we
ㅙ wae (pronounced like ㅞ)
ㅚ oe  (pronounced like ㅞ)

ㅟ wi
ㅢ ui (pronounced ㅣ when not following ㅇ (for example, 희 is pronounced 히))

Vowel harmony
-------------

Bright vowels (양성모음) have ㅏ or ㅗ as base : ㅏ ㅗ ㅑ ㅛ ㅐ ㅒ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ.
Dark   vowels (음성모음) have ㅓ or ㅜ as base : ㅓ ㅜ ㅕ ㅠ ㅔ ㅖ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅡ ㅢ.
ㅣ is Neutral (중성모음).

	Final
	=====

When the next syllable starts with ㅇ, we can orally link them together (for example, 한국어 is pronounced 한구거).

Basic consonants
----------------

ㄱ k
ㄴ n
ㄷ t
ㄹ l
ㅁ m
ㅂ p
ㅅ t
ㅇ ng
ㅈ t

ㅋ k
ㅌ t
ㅍ p
ㅊ t
ㅎ t (silent when the next syllable starts with ㅇ)

Double consonants
-----------------

ㄸ, ㅃ and ㅉ can't be used as a Final.

ㄲ k
ㅆ t

Compound consonants
-------------------

The second consonant is silent unless it can be linked to the following syllable :
ㄳ k
ㄵ n
ㄼ l (exceptions : 밟다 = 밥따, 넓죽하다 = 넙쭈카다, ...)
ㄽ l
ㄾ l
ㅄ p

ㅎ is ALWAYS silent (but .ㅎ + ㄱ = .ㅋ, .ㅎ + ㄷ = .ㅌ, .ㅎ + ㅂ = .ㅍ, .ㅎ + ㅈ = .ㅊ and .ㅎ + ㅅ = .ㅆ) :
ㄶ n
ㅀ l

ㄹ is silent but both are pronounced if the following syllable can be linked to :
ㄺ k (exceptions : 읽고 = 일코, 밝히다 = 발키다, ...)
ㄻ m
ㄿ p

		===================
		Sound Changes Rules
		===================

When a rule applies to consonant that has derivates, it usually also applies to them (for example, ㄱ -> ㄱ, ㅋ, ㄲ).
These rules apply to compound consonants too (for example, ㅄ + ㄴ = ㅁㄴ, ㅀ + ㄴ = ㄹㄹ, ...).

ㄷ, ㅌ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅎ + ㄴ = ㄴㄴ
ㄷ, ㅌ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅎ + ㅁ = ㄴㅁ

-----

ㅂ + ㄴ = ㅁㄴ
ㅂ + ㅁ = ㅁㅁ
ㄱ + ㄴ = ㅇㄴ
ㄱ + ㅁ = ㅇㅁ

-----

ㅂ, ㅁ + ㄹ = ㅁㄴ
ㄱ, ㅇ + ㄹ = ㅇㄴ

-----

ㄹ <-> ㄴ = ㄹㄹ

-----

ㅎ <-> ㄱ = .ㅋ
ㅎ <-> ㄷ = .ㅌ
ㅎ <-> ㅂ = .ㅍ
ㅎ <-> ㅈ = .ㅊ

ㅎ + ㅅ = .ㅆ
ㅅ + ㅎ = .ㅌ

-----

ㄷ + 이 = .지
ㄷ + 히 = .치
ㅌ + 이 = .치

ㄷ + 혀 = .쳐
ㅌ + 여 = .쳐
